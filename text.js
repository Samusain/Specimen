//1.) Hameed is a Yoruba boy Living in Abuja, he is a student of Nile University studying Computer Science, He has two friends John and James, they are also students of Nile University. Hameed wants to apply to Seamfix as a Program manager, so he need to send his credentials. also he wants to create a domiciliary account with Zenith Bank, Model Hameed using OOP, and outline the principle of OOP you applied at any point.

let Hameed = new Object();
Hameed.tribe = "Yoruba";
Hameed.location = "Abuja";
Hameed.school = "Nile University";
Hameed.course = "Computer Science";
Hameed.friends = ["John", "James"];

//2.) Create an object called shape that has the type property and a getType() method. Define a Triangle() constructor function whose prototype is shape. Objects created with Triangle() should have three own propertiesâ€”a, b, and c, representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Add a new method to the prototype called getPerimeter().
class Shape{
  constructor(){
        var type;
  }
  getType(){
    return this.type;
  }
  setType(type){
    this.type = type;
  }
}
var shp = new Shape();
shp.setType('Triangle');
console.log(shp.getType());
